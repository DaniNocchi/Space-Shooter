# Space Shooter

### Attention

This is Space Shooter's repository, if you want to play this game now (while it is not finished yet), download the source code and compile it with Godot 4.5

This method may (and probably will) have a lot of bugs, as the game is not finished yet.

If you want to report bugs, check the "Issues" tab above and see if the bug is already reported. If not, please, report it.

The game will be released on Steam but an old version of it is already on Steam. This is a remake made in Godot with better code and better design.

Thank you for reading!! The release date for the game will be announced as soon as I consider this game as almost finished.
